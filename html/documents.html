                        service of the United States: and the President of the United States may detach and appoint such
                        of the officers of this marine corps to act on board the frigates, and any of the armed vessels
                        of the United States, respectively, as he shall, from time to time, judge necessary, any thing
                        in the act “providing a naval armament” to the contrary hereof notwithstanding.

                        the same allowance, in case of wounds or disabilities, according to their respective ranks, as
                        are granted by the act “to ascertain and fix the military establishment of the United States.”

                        marines, who are or shall be enlisted into the service of the United States; and the
                        non-commissioned officers and musicians, who are or shall be enlisted into the army of the
                        United States, shall be, and they are hereby, exempted, during their term of service, from all
