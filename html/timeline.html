                                In an attempt to gain gunpowder for Washington's army. Commodore Hopkins took his men
                                down
                                to
                                New Providence in the Bahamas seeking supplies.
                                He gave Captain Samuel Nicholas the task of leading a raid on Fort Nassau, when met with
                                opposition, Nicholas changed course to Fort Montague.
                                At Fort Montague, Nicholas was met with little to no resistance, and was able to take
                                the
                                fort and its supplies. However, the night before the raid,
                                the British had moved most of the gunpowder out of the fort, so the raid was not as
                                successful as it could have been.

                                the United States Marine Corps was reestablished by an act of Congress, which
