          Overview of Early USMC History
        </h2>
        <p>
          The United States Marine Corps (USMC) was established on November 10, 1775, by the Second Continental Congress.
          It was created to serve as an amphibious force for the Continental Navy during the American Revolutionary War, conducting battles
          on land and sea. 
          The first official recruitment took place at Tun Tavern in Philadelphia, marking the beginning of the Marine Corps' 
          history.
          From 1775 to 1783 the Continental Marines fought in several key battles during the Revolutionary War, and by 1785 the 
          Continental Marines was already disbanded due to insufficent funding and other reasons.
          However, the need for a standing Marine Corps was recognized, leading to the reestablishment of our current USMC on July 11, 1798.
          From then on the USMC has been involved in numerous conflicts, including the War of 1812.
