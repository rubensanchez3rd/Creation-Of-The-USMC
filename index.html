          Overview of Early USMC History
        </h2>
        <p>
          The United States Marine Corps (USMC) was established on November 10, 1775, by the Second Continental Congress.
          It was created to serve as an amphibious force for the Continental Navy during the American Revolutionary War, conducting battles
          on land and sea. 
          The first official recruitment took place at Tun Tavern in Philadelphia, marking the beginning of the Marine Corps' 
          history.
          From 1775 to 1783 the Continental Marines fought in several key battles during the Revolutionary War, and by 1785 the 
          Continental Marines was already disbanded due to insufficent funding and other reasons.
          However, the need for a standing Marine Corps was recognized, leading to the reestablishment of our current USMC on July 11, 1798.
          From then on the USMC has been involved in numerous conflicts, including the War of 1812.
        </p>
        <h2>
          USMC Historical Importance
        </h2>
        <p>
          The USMC has played a crucial role in American military history, participating in every major conflict since its creation. Its amphibious capabilities and 
          rapid deployment have made it a valuable asset to U.S. military operations worldwide.
          <br><br>
          For example, the Marines' first amphibious assault at the <strong>New Providence Raid</strong> in 1776 demonstrated their ability to strike quickly
          and effectively from the sea. During the <strong>Battle of Trenton and Princeton</strong>, Marines supported Washington's forces in pivotal 
          Revolutionary War victories. The <strong>First Barbary War</strong> (1801–1805) saw Marines assault the city of Derna, 
          establishing a legacy of overseas intervention and resilience that continues to define the Corps.
          <br><br>
          These and other actions have cemented the Marine Corps' reputation as a force capable of responding to diverse threats and challenges,
           both at home and abroad.
        </p>
        <h2>
          How the USMC is Relevant Today
        </h2>
        <p>
          Today, the USMC continues to adapt to modern warfare challenges, including counterterrorism, cyber operations, and humanitarian assistance.
          Its presence in global hotspots underscores its role as a rapid response force capable of addressing diverse threats.
          The Marine Corps remains a symbol of American military excellence and resilience, with a legacy that inspires future generations of service members.
